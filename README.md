## About

Learning to work with the web is one of those crucial skills to be able to develop powerful applications. Thanks to the latest Swift updates, working with concurrency has become more intuitive than ever before, and integrating asynchronous requests into SwiftUI is as intuitive as adding a modifier!

Here you will understand how to manage and manage requests to a particular web service, such as an API.
Learn how to get and share information on the web, using JSON as the structure of your objects.
Solve the puzzle described during the activity by submitting requests on the web.

In this repository you can find the implementation of an E-Shop app that allows you to display randomly generated projects from a public `API`.

More information about the API here:
[Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com)

This design has been implemented in three different ways (only the network stack), which allows us to explore three different design patters/Frameworks with which network requests can be implemented.

1. `Completition Handler`:
2. `Async/Await`:
3. `Combine`:
